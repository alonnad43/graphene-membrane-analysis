This project simulates and compares the water flux, mechanical properties, and oil rejection performance of Graphene Oxide (GO), Reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO), and hybrid membranes.

- Use Python (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy) for all simulations and plotting.
- No chemical modeling; only physical properties and empirical data.
- Data import/export should support CSV and JSON.
- All simulation code should be modular and well-documented.
